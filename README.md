# Webi

Webi is a web browser that allows you to chat with anyone on the internet. It creates a chat room for each unique URL so that people who end up on the same webpage can communicate with each other. It aims to create a sense of community within the web by connecting people with similar interests and web browsing habits. Also, it opens up freedom of speech on the internet by providing a place for people to leave comments on webpages that either block or doesn't support comments.

Webi is the Android version of the Minnehack project created by Yehyun Ryu, Nikhil Shahi, Issac Gullickson, and Joshua Palm. The Android app was developed by Yehyun Ryu and the Chrome extension was developed by Nikhil Shahi, Issac Gullickson, and Joshua Palm.
